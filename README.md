Welcome to Simpleweblite, your go-to starter kit for building web pages without the overhead of heavy frameworks. This repository provides a clean and efficient structure to help you develop web pages quickly while avoiding repetitive tasks. With Simpleweblite, you can create and reuse components, ensuring a smooth and modular development process.

# Introduction
Simpleweblite is designed for developers who prefer to build websites without relying on modern frameworks. It provides a simple, flexible structure to organize your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/Typescript files, allowing you to focus on building clean and maintainable code. With features like easy template rendering, Simpleweblite saves time and effort in web development.

# Features
- Component Reusability: Create and reuse components across different pages, reducing repetitive tasks.
- Partial Registration: Define reusable HTML snippets (partials) that can be included in multiple views.
- TypeScript Support: Written in TypeScript, but fully compatible with JavaScript projects.
- Lightweight: Minimal dependencies and easy to integrate into existing projects.

## To get started
Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/bright-webb/simpleweblite-starter-kit.git
cd simpleweblite-starter-kit
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Rendering Views
```
import { Render } from 'simpleweblite';
export async function Index(): Promise<string> {
    return Render('Index', {title: 'Home page', 'Welcome to simpleweblite');
  }
```
Render function can also be used to load HTML content. For example
`const Header = Render('templates/Header')`

## Registing Partials
Use `RegisterPartial` to define reusable partials
```
import { RegisterPartial } from 'simpleweblite';
RegisterPartial('header', '<h1>Header</h1>')
```
Once registered, the partial can be used in any view
```
<html>
  <body>
    {{> header }}
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
